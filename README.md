# Projects
In these analytics projects, I leveraged data-driven methodologies to optimize business performance in both the e-commerce and banking sectors. Using tools like Excel, Power BI, MySQL, and Tableau, I transformed raw data into actionable insights that enhanced decision-making and business strategies.

For the E-Commerce Analytics project, I analyzed customer purchasing behavior and payment trends on the Olist platform. Through KPI evaluations, I identified areas for improvement, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and improved sales performance. A dynamic dashboard was developed to provide a comprehensive overview of store performance.

In the Bank Analytics project, I conducted meticulous data cleaning and organization using Power Query in Excel and Power BI. I developed interactive visualizations to analyze loan market trends and identify key growth factors. These insights helped formulate strategic offers, attracting new customers and driving business expansion.

Through these projects, I successfully improved customer engagement, optimized marketing strategies, and contributed to measurable business growth.
